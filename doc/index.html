      <p>
        SequenceServer requires the location of NCBI BLAST+ binaries and the
        location of database sequences (either in FASTA or BLAST database
        format) to run. These can be specified using command line parameters
        or through a configuration file.

        SequenceServer looks for a configuration file by default at
        <code>~/.sequenceserver.conf</code>. This can be changed by
        using the <code>-c</code> option:
        <code>sequenceserver -c ~/.sequenceserver.ants.conf</code>.

      </p>
      <p>
        Configuration files have a simple key-value syntax and can be viewed
        and modified with standard tools. Alternatively, <code>-s</code> option
        can be used to add an arbitrary key-value to the configuration file or
        to change the value of a key:
      </p>

{% highlight shell %}
sequenceserver -c ~/.sequenceserver.ants.conf -s -d /path/to/new/location/of/database/sequences
sequenceserver -s -b /path/to/latest/blast/binaries
{% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        The following table lists all configuration values accepted by
        SequenceServer through the configuration file or through command line
        options. Command line options take precendence over the values in

        <h2>
          Creating BLAST databases
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The BLAST search algorithms don't directly understand FASTA files.
        BLAST includes the <code>makeblastdb</code> tool that is used to
        convert FASTA files into the optimized BLASTDB format, which is
        then used by the search algorithms:
      </p>

      <pre>makeblastdb -dbtype &lt;prot_or_nucl&gt; -title &lt;human_readable_name&gt; -in &lt;path_to_fasta&gt; -parse_seqids</pre>

      <p>
        SequenceServer's <code>makeblastdb</code> wrapper can recursively scan a
        directory for FASTA files and prompt you to convert them into BLAST
        databases. SequenceServer automatically determines whether the file
        contains nucleotide or amino acid sequences so you don't have to specify
        it yourself and suggests a human readable name by "cleaning" the FASTA
        file name.
      </p>

      <p>
        SequenceServer does this automatically when it does not find any BLASTDB
        files in <code>database_dir</code>. Rest of the times you can invoke
        this functionality manually, such as after adding new FASTA files to
        <code>database_dir</code>.
      </p>

      <pre>sequenceserver -m</pre>

      <p>
        The above command reads <code>database_dir</code> from the default
        configuration file(<code>~/.sequenceserver.conf</code>), but that
        can be changed:
      </p>

      <pre>sequenceserver -m -d /path/to/directory_with_fasta_files
sequenceserver -m -c /path/to/config_file_containing_database_dir</pre>

      <p>
        If you would like to include taxonomy id of sequences in the database,
        you can do so by including <code>.taxid_map.txt</code> file next to the
        FASTA file. For example, if your FASTA file is
        <code>/database_dir/ants.fa</code>, the taxid map file must be called
        <code>/database_dir/ants.taxid_map.txt</code>. If you have this file,
        SequenceServer will automatically use it with
        <code>-taxid_map</code> option of <code>makeblastdb</code>. The file is
        expected to contain a sequence id and a taxonomy id on each line.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not have this file, SequenceSever will prompt you to enter one
        taxonomy id that can be used for all sequences in the FASTA file. You
        can get the taxonomy id of a species at <a
        href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">NCBI Taxonomy browser</a>.
      </p>

      <p>An example prompt:</p>

<pre>
FASTA file: /Users/priyam/biodb/protein/Solenopsis_invicta/SI2.2.3.fa
FASTA type: protein
Proceed? [y/n] (Default: y):
Enter a database title or will use 'SI 2.2.3 ':
Enter taxid (optional): 13686
</pre>

        SequenceServer when a FASTA file is added to database directory.

        <h2>
          Upgrading BLAST databases
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        NCBI has introduced a new BLAST database format, called version 5. If
        you have a mix of the old, version 4, and version 5 databases in your
        databases directory, it can cause unexpected problems. Furthermore,
        for features like FASTA download to work correctly, it is important
        that BLAST databases are created using the <code>-parse_seqids</code>
        option of <code>makeblastdb</code>.

      </p>
      <p>
        SequenceServer checks for such incompatibilities automatically on
        startup and offers to upgrade problematic databases. This works even
        if you have lost the original FASTA file from which the database was
        created. Human readable database name and taxonomy identifiers in the
        datbases are preserved during the upgrade. Note that you may find
        intermediate FASTA and taxid map files in the databases directory
        after upgrading databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also invoke this functionality by running <code>sequenceserver
        -m</code>.

        NCBI provides publicly available sequences as pre-formatted BLAST
        databases and can be downloaded with <code>update_blastdb.pl</code>
        script distributed with BLAST. Since these databases are huge, they
        are split across several files (volumes) and linked together with an
        alias file. SequenceServer works seamlessly with such, multi-part
        databases. We also have an alternative to
        <code>update_blastdb.pl</code> to download BLAST databases from NCBI
        faster: <a href="https://github.com/yeban/ncbi-blast-dbs">ncbi-blast-dbs</a>.

        Further, SequenceServer understands NCBI sequence ids and automatically
        links to NCBI page corresponding to the hit sequences from the HTML
        report.

        SequenceServer automatically includes scientific name of the species in
        its HTML report. All taxonomy data returned by BLAST is provided in the
        "Full tabular report" download option. For this to work, BLAST database
        files should contain taxonomy id of the sequences and you must have
        downloaded NCBI "taxdb".
      </p>

      <p>
        See "Creating BLAST databases" section for how to include taxonomy
        information in BLASTDB files. If you are using BLAST databases
        downloaded from NCBI then you don't need to worry about this -
        taxonomy information is included in the database files.
      </p>

      <p>
        To download NCBI taxdb, run:
      </p>

<pre>
<code>sequenceserver --download-taxdb</code>
</pre>

      <p>
        The above command downloads taxdb files to <code>~/.sequenceserver</code>,
        where SequenceServer keeps a few other files as well.

      </div>
      <p>
        With a few exceptions, all command-line BLAST+ parameters can be
        provided using the "Advanced params" textbox in the search form.
        Options that change input/output behaviour (e.g.,
        <code>-query</code>, <code>-db</code>, <code>-subject</code>,
        <code>-outfmt</code>, <code>-import_search_strategy</code>) are
        not allowed.
      <p>
      <p>
        For security, only letters, numbers, space, hyphen, underscore,
        and period are allowed in "Advanced params" textbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        SequenceServer changes BLAST+'s default:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>-evalue 1e-5</code> is added to all searches
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>-task blastn</code> is added to BLASTN searches
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The above changes are applied transparently, i.e., they are added to the
        'Advanced params' textbox once you have pasted your query and selected
        the databases and can be overriden.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible to customise advanced options for each BLAST algorithm by
        setting them in the configuration file.

        <h2>
          Adding links to search hits
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        It is often desirable to link search hits to external resources such as
        NCBI, UniProt, or a genome browser. SequenceServer provides a powerful
        and flexible mechanism to do this.

        Simply edit <code>lib/sequenceserver/links.rb</code> in your
        SequenceServer installation directory to add a link generator function,
        based on examples and documentation provided in that file.

        Alternatively, you can write your link generator functions in a
        separate file and load it through <code>:require_file:</code> key in
        config file.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can access methods defined in the <a
          href="http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/SequenceServer/BLAST/Hit"><code>Hit</code></a>
        class within a link generator. Alignment coordinates are not defined on a hit, but on hsps. Calling
        <code>hsps</code> method (in link generator) will return an Array of <a
          href="http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/SequenceServer/BLAST/HSP">HSP</a> objects for
        that Hit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Which database a hit came from is not provide by BLAST in it’s output. You can call out to <code>whichdb</code>
        method from your link generator to get a list of all databases that the hit could have come from. If your
        sequences have unique ids across _all_ FASTA files / BLAST databases, you know that the only element in the list
        is the database that the hit came from. <code>whichdb</code> returns an Array of <a
          href="http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yannickwurm/sequenceserver/SequenceServer/Database"><code>SequenceServer::Database</code></a>
        objects from which you can get database title and path. <code>whichdb</code> is slow. Alternative is to encode
        db info (a short name) in the sequence id, and use regex matching to decide which database a hit came from.
      </p>

      <p>
        URL parameters should be encoded. It replaces whitespace and other relevant chars in the string with % encoding
        followed in URLs.

        <h2>
          Sharing with colleagues
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        If your IP is publicly accessible, your colleagues will be able to access
        your SequenceServer instance at <code>http://your-ip:4567</code>, or a
        particular search result at <code>http://your-ip:4567/job-id</code>. This
        usually requires being in the same subnetwork, or asking IT services to
        open your machine to the outside world. You may also want to ask IT
        services for a fixed IP.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already have a fixed, public IP but port 4567 is blocked by a
        firewall, you can try running SequenceServer on a different port:
        <code>sequenceserver -p 8080</code>. Administrator privilege is
        required to use port 80: <code>sudo sequenceserver -p 80</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can disable sharing
        by setting <code>:host:</code> key in config file to
        <code>127.0.0.1</code>: <code>sequenceserver -s -H 127.0.0.1</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        BLAST results are stored for 30 days by default. You can change this by
        setting the <code>:job_lifetime:</code> key in configuration file (the
        value is specified in minutes).

      <p>
        SequenceServer's built-in webserver can handle medium workloads.
        Though, for large communities or to integrate SequenceServer as part of
        existing websites it may be desirable to run SequenceServer with Apache.
        Also, setting up with Apache means SequenceServer will automatically be
        available when server restarts.
      </p>
      <p>
        To setup SequenceServer with Apache, first install Phusion Passenger™ by following the <a
          href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/apache/install/oss/">instructions at their website</a>.
        Then configure Apache to load SequenceServer by following their guide on <a
          href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/deploy/apache/deploy/ruby/">deploying a Ruby applicaion</a>,
        replacing <code>/path-to-your-app</code> with SequenceServer's installation directory. Finally, go to the
        directory where SequenceServer is installed and edit <code>config.ru</code> to indicate absolute path to
        SequenceServer's config file and <code>DOTDIR</code> which are respectively <code>~/.sequenceserver.conf</code>
        and <code>~/.sequenceserver</code> by default:
      </p>
{% highlight ruby %}
# Remove this line.
SequenceServer.init

# And add these two, changing the path.
SequenceServer::DOTDIR = "/home/foo/.sequenceserver"
SequenceServer.init :config_file => "/home/foo/.sequenceserver.conf"
{% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        For SequenceServer 1.0.7 and earlier, you will additionally need to
        delete <code>Gemfile</code> from SequenceServer's installation
        directory.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you plan to deploy multiple SequenceServer instances, you should
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sequenceserver/FWI0Dq_2erw/SV6H_tTxBgAJ">
          deploy each to a sub-uri</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you deploy to a sub-uri a trailing slash is required for JS, CSS and
        the icons to load properly. Ideally, just putting a trailing slash in
        Apache config should be sufficient. See
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sequenceserver/NIfKTNm1om4">
          this thread</a> for more solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, because BLAST searches can take time, you may additionally want to configure <a
          href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#timeout"><code>Timeout</code></a> in your Apache config
        to a suitable value (e.g., 5 minutes) so that the Apache doesn't close the connection before a BLAST search has
        been performed.

      <p>
        In reverse proxy setup, requests are forwarded from Nginx (or Apache) to SequenceServer's built-in server.
        Following config indicates how to proxy requests from Nginx to SequenceServer from a sub-uri of your domain
        (my-domain.com/sequenceserver). Nginx will timeout requests if it can't connect to SequenceServer within 8
        seconds or if it doesn't hear back from SequenceServer within 180 seconds (3 minutes) after it forwarded the
        request (that is, BLAST requests that take more than than 3 minutes will be timed out by Nginx). Please see
        Nginx documentation for details info of each directive.

}
{% endhighlight %}

      <p>
        SequenceServer can be integrated with Nginx similar to Apache, using Phusion Passenger. And Apache can be used
        instead of Nginx to proxy connections as well. Whether to use reverse proxy or Phusion Passenger and Apache or
        Nginx is up to the user. A discussion of pros and cons of each is beyond the scope of this documentation.

        Given SequenceServer simply runs NCBI BLAST+ commands in the shell it's
        relatively easy to devise a scheme to run BLAST searches on another,
        more powerful computer or on cluster. For example, by replacing BLAST+
        binaries with a "shim" like below, we can run BLAST searches on another
        computer using SSH.
      </p>

{% highlight shell %}
#!/usr/bin/env sh

blast=`basename $0`
param=`echo "$@" | sed "s/\-db\ /\-db\ \'/" | sed "s/\ \-query\ /\'\ \-query\ /"`

ssh hostname /usr/local/bin/$blast $param

      <p>
        Using a job queuing system such as <code>qsub</code> may be a bit

        and <a href="https://github.com/wurmlab/sequenceserver/issues/445">Loraine Brillet-Guéguen</a>.

      </p>

      <p>
        SequenceServer's development mode, activated as <code> sequenceserver
          -D</code> enables verbose logging and loads unbuilt assets (JS and
        CSS). SequenceServer's interactive command-line mode, activated as
        <code> sequenceserver -i</code> lets you access all server-side objects
        and methods, call them and inspect their output in Ruby.

          <strong>View sequence link is disabled if the length of the hit
            exceeds 10,000 residues</strong> - ok if target sequences are
          proteins or contigs. We feel this mode of visualising sequences
          is not optimal for very long sequences (e.g., scaffolds).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>During setup on some versions of OS X, an extra space is added
            at the end of autocompleted paths when SequenceServer prompts for
            paths to the BLAST+ executables or database directory</strong>. This
          appears to be due to a bug in Ruby readline library. Unfortunately it
          is beyond our scope to fix this slightly inconvenient

            bug</a>, especially since working around it is straightforward
          (i.e. you just need to backspace it).

          1. Can I use SequenceServer as an access-point for a community
          genome database?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Yes. SequenceServer is used as data querying mechnism in over 30
          <a href="/#users">community databases</a>.
          You can use SequenceServer as it is along with supporting pages
          describing the data and related resources (e.g., <a href="http://hopbase.org">HopBase</a>), customise it
          extensively (e.g., <a href="https://lotus.au.dk">Lotus Base</a>),
          or integrate it with InterMine (e.g., <a href="https://planmine.mpibpc.mpg.de/planmine/begin.do">PlanMine</a>).
        </dd>
        <dt>
          2. Does SequenceServer include a genome browser?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          No, but any web based genome browser such as
          <a href="https://jbrowse.org">JBrowse</a>,
          <a href="http://www.biodalliance.org">Biodalliance</a>, or
          <a href="https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js">igv.js</a> can be
          used. Also see: <a href="#jbrowse">Integrating with JBrowse</a>
          and <a href="#plugin">Adding links to search hits</a>.

          3. Is it possible to disable Grammarly for the query sequences?
        </dt>
        <dd>
        Yes, but each user would have to do it themselves:

      <!--summary:-->
      <!--<blockquote>-->
      <p>
        BLAST is a heuristic, i.e., it is fast and approximate instead of
        being slow and perfect. It starts by looking for a minimal 100%
        match (e.g., 11 consecutive nucleotides with 100% identity between
        your query and the database sequence). If it finds none its over.
        If it does find a match, it extends that in both directions:
        identical (or similar) bases add points; differences are negative
        points. If too many points are lost, it stops aligning. BLAST
        might not stop at the exact best place, alignment ends might be
        wrong.
        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21106/def-item/app8/">
          bitscore
        </a>
        is the total number of points for the aligning region. The bigger
        it is, the stronger the alignment. But the bitscore doesn't take
        into account sequence length nor database size. The E-value does
        take these into account. It is better to look at E-values than
        bitscores. The <strong>E-value</strong> represents the number of
        times the observed alignment would be expected to occur by chance
        (it is not a p-value!); <strong>depends on the bitscore, the length
          of the query sequence, and the cumulative length of all sequences
          in the database</strong>. It is easier to talk about
        <em>strong</em> E-values (e.g. 1e-100 = 10<sup>-100</sup> = almost
        zero; impossible to obtain by chance) vs <em>weak</em> E-values
        (e.g 0.1; for similarity that may be due to chance) than small vs
        large (which is always a bit confusing).

        <a href="/publications/ncbiBlast.pdf">
          BLAST
        </a>
        has been rewritten several times - most recently by NCBI as BLAST+.
        NCBI now use and recommend using BLAST+.
        <a href="/publications/blastplus.pdf">
          The BLAST+ publication
        </a>
        explains why BLAST+ is easier to use and faster than the old
        <em>legacy</em> BLAST. WU-BLAST is now commercial and called
        <a href="http://blast.advbiocomp.com/">
          AB-BLAST</a>.
        There is probably no good reason to use either alternative. Note
        that the output formats change slightly from one BLAST
        implementation to the next.

        NCBI's BLAST+ is actively developed and is the only one supported
        by SequenceServer.
